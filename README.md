# Photo-Prototypes-
Photo Prototypes are experiments I am running to try to grow mycelium onto inkjet photographs. Inkjet inks contain a variety of chemicals that are incredibly hard to break down and some colors are even composed of heavy metals. The photographs are also printed on archival paper, which contains fungicides and herbicides so as to not allow the photographs to decompose readily. I am testing the strength of the fungi to see if, with a little help, they can grow in these conditions. I have prepared a basic agar medium (the recipe is listed in my recipe tab) and after sterilizing the media, I've dipped the photos into the media and then placed them in a petri dish. After they cooled, I took tissue samples from six different fungal species and inoculated the plates. So far, the only species that are growing are: Pleurotus Ostreatus, Fomes Fomentarius, and Amanita Muscaria
